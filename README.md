# Recordly

Went a little overboard since it's hard to not have at least a semi functional product.

You can find a live working demo [here](http://recordly-joelrojo.herokuapp.com/).

Current working features include:

- User signup, login, and logout
- View Favorite tracks
- View and add albums (no duplicate songs, artist)
- Ability to favorite albums
- Individual views for Artist, Song, and 

## Tech Stack

- Django 1.9.2 backend
- Basic jQuery/CSS frontend
- Heroku deployment - [Live app](http://recordly-joelrojo.herokuapp.com/)

## Improvements for the future

- Simplify adding album experience and view
- Scale ability to favorite items to songs and albums
- Leverage React.js to turn this into a SPA (single page application)
- Account management and password recovery
- Associate Songs and Artist models with user
- Better experience for frontend validation for duplicate entries
